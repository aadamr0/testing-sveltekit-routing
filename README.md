**Created a barebones SvelteKit project to spike the framework and test its routing capabilities** <br>
To run the project locally:<br>
- Clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/aadamr0/Preact-Navbar-Spiking.git`
- Run `cd Preact-Navbar-Spiking` to enter the project directory
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run dev`
- Follow instructions in the terminal to open the project in the broswer <br>
<br>
From [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hXHbGj6iE0&list=PLA9WiRZ-IS_zfHpxmztJQLeBISsQkh9-M&index=3), my takeaway is that SvelteKit seems like a great solution for web development, routing was simple and intuitive; I'll try to make a larger project using this framework.<br>
